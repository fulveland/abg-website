            <h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Gather Materials</h3>
            <p>Grab 15 cattail leaves and lay them out on a table.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        On either side of the cattail there is a a thin papery strip (wing). Remove them from every cattail. You can put these aside to dry. You wont be needing them for this project.

        <p>
            Choose the two nicest leaves, often the heart leaves, and set them aside.

        <h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">Mark Ends for Clarity</h3>
        <p>
        From the remaining leaves, prepare the spokes by marking the butt end with a 45° angled cut to distinguish it from the tip.
        </p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em;">Prepare Spokes</h2>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">Calculate Dimensions</h3>

<p>Basket Dimmensions:</p>
    <ul>
		<li>Side: 4”</li>
        <li>Bottom: 3.5”</li>
    </ul>
    

<p>Spoke Length Calculation:
    <ul>
		<li>You will need to add 6" to either side for the border.</li>
		<li>6” (border) + 4” (side) + 3.5” (bottom) + 4” (side) + 6” (border) = 23.5”</li>
		<li>Round up to 24” for simplicity.</li>
    </ul>

        Will you need more spokes to fill your rows? If you do, pick an edge that needs a spoke and rotate it up so it will be easy to weave into the edge.

        <p>
            Pairing uses two weavers. We will make our two weavers by splitting one of the leaves from our weaver pile in half.
        </p>
    </div>

<div class="container">

        <p>
            We will begin our weaving on the left side of the first unsecured spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wrap the first “split” weaver around the spoke so the butt is on the left side and the tip is on the right side. The tip end should be about 6" long, and the butt end should be much longer.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <img class="" src="/images/cattail-basket-assets/second-weaver.jpg" alt=""/>

        <p>
            Wrap your second “split” weaver on the same spoke. This time the butt will be on the right, and the 6" of tip will be on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are now ready to begin pairing.

            <h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Switch to a 3 rod whale </h3>

            <p>
                When whaling, we want our weavers to be nice and thick. We will no longer split the weavers in half. Instead, we will use full-sized leaves. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                A 3-rod wale requires three weavers. To start, add a third full-sized weaver to the right of the two pairing weavers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now we have three weavers, but two of them are still the thinner pairing weavers. Weaving with these would create an uneven texture, so we will “fatten” them by joining a full-sized leaf to each of the thinner weavers.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>


    



Steps to Transition to a 3-Rod Whale:

	1.	Move the leftmost weaver “Over 2, Behind 1.”
	2.	Attach a new full-sized leaf to the rightmost weaver.
	3.	Move the (new) leftmost weaver “Over 2, Behind 1.”
	4.	Attach another full-sized leaf to the current rightmost weaver.

All three weavers are full-sized, continue around the basket 3 times with the 3-rod whale pattern "infront 2 behind 1".

            <p>
                Spray down your spokes and use a wet towel to wrap and rest them if needed.
            <p>
            </p>
            Gently twist and massage your spokes.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">Lay down the border</h3>
    <p>
        Gently, without creasing, fold back your first spoke, leaving an inch of space between the top of the waling and the fold.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take the first spoke behind one, in front of one, and then leave it in the back.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moving right, take your next spoke and gently fold it back, leaving the same 1” space.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take this spoke behind one, in front of one, and leave it in the back.
    </p>
    <p>
        Repeat for the remaining spokes.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Tidy up</h3>
    <p>Pull your ends to tidy the border, and when you are happy, pinch the folds to crease them.</p>
