    <h3>Why a Sally Garden?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Give us a reliable source of cuttings in Alberta so our members can plant and grow there own willow for
            weaving
        </li>
        <li> Give members who do not have the ability to grow there own willow access to cultivated willow. </li>
        <li> Create a supply of willow for workshops where the instructor is coming from out of town. </li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <h3>How can you help?</h3>
    <p>
        Right now we need help keeping the willow watered. The willow cuttings are just getting settled into its new
        home and should be watered every second day.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>
        You will be compinsated for your time in willow. When the Sally Garden starts producing we will divy up the
        willow so the each person will get an allotment of willow based on the hours volunteered.
