<h2>Preparation</h2>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Gather Materials:
</h3>
<p>
    Grab 15 cattail leaves and lay them out on a table.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Select Heart Leaves:
</h3>
<p>
    Choose the two nicest leaves, often the heart leaves, and set them aside.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">	Mark Ends for Clarity
From the remaining leaves, prepare the spokes by marking the butt end with a 45° angled cut to distinguish it from the tip.
</h3>

<h2>Prepare Spokes</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Calculate Dimensions	
</h3>
<p>
    <ul>Basket Dimmensions:
		<li>•	Side: 4”</li>
        <li>•	Bottom: 3.5”</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Spoke Length Calculation:
		You will need to add 6" to either side for the border.
		•	6” (border) + 4” (side) + 3.5” (bottom) + 4” (side) + 6” (border) = 23.5”		
		•	Round up to 24” for simplicity.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Cut Spokes
</h3>
<p>
    •	Measure 24” from the butt end of each cattail and make a straight cut.
	•	Put the butts (spokes) in one pile and the tips (weavers) in another.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Organize Spokes
	Lay out the 13 spokes with tips at the top and butts at the bottom.
</h3>

/ Spoke Arrangement	

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Divide Spokes
</h3>
<p>
    •	Save the 3 thinnest spokes for the edges of the basket.
		• Separate the remaining 10 spokes into two rows of five spokes each. 
</p>		
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Arrange Spokes by Thickness
</h3>
<p>
	•	In each row, position the thickest butts in the middle and the thinnest on the edges.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Stagger Butts and Tips
</h3>
<p>
    •	Flip every second cattail so the butt is on top.
</p>
/ Weaving the Basket Base

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">		Set Up the Block
</h3>
<p>
	•	Position the block with the elastic band at one short end and the string running down the center.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Place Vertical Spokes
</h3>
<p>
    •	Lay the first row of five spokes (thinnest on edges, thickest in the middle) under the string, centering them evenly.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Weave Horizontal Spokes
	<p>
    •	Move the string down an inch.
	•	Using the fattest weaver, weave under one, over one across the vertical spokes.
	
	•	Repeat with the next fattest weaver, alternating the pattern.
	
	•	Repeat with the skinniest weaver, alternating the pattern.
	
	•	Flip the block and repeat on the opposite side with the remaining spokes.
    </p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">Secure Spokes
</h3>
<p>
	Tie the spokes to the block with a string running perpendicular to the original one, forming a “t”.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">Assess the spacing
</h3>
<p>
Will you need more spokes to fill your rows? If you do, pick an edge that needs a spoke and rotate it up so it will be easy to weave into the edge.

Keep adding spokes until this “first” edge is full.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Turn up
</h3>
<p>
    When your first edge is full, it is time to turn up. Fold your leaves along the edge of the block and secure them with an elastic.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Working the your first edge
</h3>
<p>
Keep the first spoke secured under the elastic and remove the remaining spokes for this edge from under the elastic.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Two rounds of pairing
</h3>
<p>
    Pairing uses two weavers. We will make our two weavers by splitting one of the leaves from our weaver pile in half.
<p>
<p>
    We will begin our weaving on the left side of the first unsecured spoke.
</p>

Wrap the first “split” weaver around the spoke so the butt is on the left side and the tip is on the right side. The tip end should be about 6" long, and the butt end should be much longer.

Wrap your second “split” weaver on the same spoke. This time the butt will be on the right, and the 6" of tip will be on the left.

We are now ready to begin pairing.

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Paring
</h3>
<p>
    In front of one behind one.

Grab the left weaver (this includes the tiny tip), bring it in front of the spoke, over the “right” weaver, behind the spoke, and out to the front. It is now the right weaver. Grab the weaver that is now on the left and repeat until you get to the end of this edge.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Refasten spokes
</h3>
<p>
    Secure all of the spokes under the elastic. Rotate the block so the next edge is up. Pull out all of the spokes for this edge from under the elastic.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Fill any gaps
</h3>
<p>
    Does this edge need another spoke to fill it? If it does, put it in and then confirm that your weaver looks like the one in the picture.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Twist the corners
</h3>
<p>
    On this first round of pairing, you will need to do a single twist at every corner.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Complete the first round
</h3>
<p>
    From there, continue pairing and adding in spokes until you get all the way around.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Second round of pairing
</h3>
<p>
    Do one more round of pairing.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> switch to a 3 rod whale 
</h3>
<p>
    Add a third weaver to the right of the two pairing weavers and join a full-size weaver to each of the split weavers you were pairing with.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> waling
</h3>
<p>
    starting with your left weaver
in front of 2, behind 1

When you have done 3 rounds of waling, sew your ends under 3 rows of waling on the back.
</h3>
<p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> 1st round of checkerboard
</h3>
<p>
Start on a corner. In front of 1, behind 1.

Once you have completed a loop around the basket, overlap 4 inches and then cut your weaver, leaving a 2” tail.
</h3>
<p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> 2nd round of checkerboard
</h3>
<p>
Start on the opposite side of the basket from where you did last time. If the first row of the checkerboard went over the spoke, this time you are going to go under.

Once you have completed a loop around the basket, overlap 4 inches and then cut your weaver, leaving a tail.
</h3>
<p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">  round of checkerboard
</h3>
<p>
Start on a different corner than your first 2 rounds. If the second row of the checkerboard went over the spoke, this time you are going to go under.

Once you have completed a loop around the basket, overlap 4 inches and then cut your weaver, leaving a tail.

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> 3 more rounds of waling
</h3>
<p>
Set up three weavers for waling.

In front of 2, behind 1.

Once you are done with 3 rounds of waling, sew in your weavers. Go under 3 rows of waling in the back.

</p>
/ Border Time!

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Prepare the spokes
</h3>
<p>
    Spray down your spokes and use a wet towel to wrap and rest them if needed.

Gently twist and massage your spokes.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> 
</h3>
<p>Lay down the border
</p>
<p>
    Gently, without creasing, fold back your first spoke, leaving an inch of space between the top of the waling and the fold.
</p>
<p>
Take the first spoke behind one, in front of one, and then leave it in the back.
</p>
<p>
Moving right, take your next spoke and gently fold it back, leaving the same 1” space.
</p>
<p>
Take this spoke behind one, in front of one, and leave it in the back.
</p>
<p>
Repeat for the remaining spokes.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;"> Tidy up</h3>
<p>Pull your ends to tidy the border, and when you are happy, pinch the folds to crease them.</p>
