                <p>
                    This workshop is a great introduction to willow without all the challenges of willow. All the
                    techniques used in this round commercial reed basket can be used in making the same willow basket.
                    Commercial reed is much easier to work with than willow. You will learn how to twine, 3 rod wale,
                    French rand and a basic willow rim.
                </p>
                <p>Tools you should bring: Spray bottle, sharp scissors or basket shears, tape measure, awl.</p>

                    For those who already have some experience and want a BIG project. We will learn an oval base, stake
                    and strand. We will choose either a double French rand or an English rand side weave and a 5 by 2
                    border. We will use native ditch willows , so tight, tight, tight will be encouraged. These will
                    hold your socks!! You could do this one basket with two people weaving. The instruction and
                    materials for this class are charged per a basket. There is no extra charge if two people are
                    working together on a basket.

                    birch bark, iris and day lily leaves. 4 hours
