                    This workshop is a great introduction to willow without all the challenges of willow. All the
                    techniques used in this round commercial reed basket can be used in making the same willow basket.
                    Commercial reed is much easier to work with than willow. You will learn how to twine, 3 rod wale,
                    French rand and a basic willow rim.
                </p>
                <p>Tools you should bring: Spray bottle, sharp scissors or basket shears, tape measure, awl.</p>

        <h2>Rae Hunter</h2>
        <p>
            Rae Hunter was born in Lethbridge Alberta... just to be near her parents. Her work as a leadership and
            community development consultant for the Alberta Government evolved naturally into her later becoming a
            "basket case"
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortified with government grants, and a lifelong fascination with natural materials, Rae took to the wilds
            in the early 90's to give vent to her creative passion, basketry. Since then, she has used a variety of
            seemingly unbasket-like materials, to create some of the finest artworks in this craft.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 1992. she has taught basketry courses throughout Alberta, as well as in British Columbia, Yukon
            territories and though United States.

    <div class="description">
        <h2 style="margin-top: 2em">Arielle Prince-Ferron</h2>
        <p>
            Arielle Prince-Ferron is a basket weaver and storyteller. She discovered the art of basketry 12 years ago.
            In 2020, she created Brins d'Nature, a small scale business born from a desire to devote herself totally to
            her passion for weaving with nature, to share an ancient skill that is slowly being lost and to offer an
            alternative to the accelerated degradation of our ecosystems and our overall mental health. She enjoys
            creating various practical objects for everyday life, as well as weaving living willow structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            She works only with local plants harvested by hand in a respectful way. Such as wild and cultivated willow
            from her willow garden, dogwood, roots, birch-cedar and willow bark, cattails leaves and other beautiful
            plants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arielle learned various basketry techniques, mainly self-taught and with a few teachers from Quebec, Vermont
            and Japan. She also been facilitating groups of all ages for the last 12 years around nature connection, art
            in nature and empathy. Her focus is to create a small revolution where relation to all life matters, and
            where we care for the living world and each other.

    <h1>Accommodations</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Townhouse:</strong> A few of us are getting together to rent a townhouse about 15 minutes away from the
        retreat. We have a few more rooms available for $60 a night. If you would like to join us, please indicate it in
        your registration form or email us at borchfam@hotmail.com.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Tenting:</strong> We will have limited space for tents this year to accommodate all the new classes we
        are offering. Preference will be given to tenters who intend to stay for the whole weekend. If you are planning
        to tent, make sure you get your registration in as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Billeting:</strong> We have had a few of our members offer space in their homes for the duration of the
        retreat. Each home is different, but most people are offering a room for between $0 and $15 a night. If you
        would like to stay with someone or have room to offer another attendee, let us know in your registration form or
        send us an email at borchfam@hotmail.com.
